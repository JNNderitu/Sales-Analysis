# Problem Statement.

Analyzing fictional data from an online learning platform offering courses in various categories. I’ll track course sales, instructor performance, learner engagement, and payment methods across months.

## Key Questions to Explore:
1.	Which course categories generated the highest revenue?
2.	Who are the top-performing instructors?
3.	What’s the monthly trend of total sales?
4.	Which countries have the most active learners?
5.	What payment methods are most used?
6.	What’s the average course rating per category?

### Steps followed:
- step 1 : Load data into Power BI.
- step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under the data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- step 3 : Also since by default, profile will open only top 1000 rows, select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- step 4 : The dashboard contains 3 pages;
- * overview of courses and sales analysis.
  * Sales Analysis showing the revenue performance of different courses and their trend.
  * Course Analysis showing course-wise performance, rating and trends by country and sales.
  * Summary showing the KPI's and conclusions.
- Visual filters used include:
  * course category
  * course name
  * instructor
  * country
  * payment method
